# ADR 1: React Native and TypeScript for Cross-Platform Client UI

## Status

Accepted

## Context

"Home Cook Collective" needs a user interface for web and mobile (iOS/Android) to serve diverse user personas. Key drivers are broad reach, development efficiency for a new project, desire for a consistent UX, leveraging existing team web skills (React/JS), and rapid feature delivery.

## Decision

We will use **React Native** and **TypeScript** to develop our user interface for all platforms (web, iOS, Android).

## Rationale

This approach was chosen because:

- It allows for a single UI codebase across web and mobile, significantly reducing development time and cost compared to separate native and web efforts.
- TypeScript enhances code quality and maintainability.
- It leverages existing team skills within the React ecosystem and enables faster MVP delivery.

### Rejected Alternatives

- **Native iOS/Android + Separate Web:** Rejected due to significantly higher development time, cost, and resource needs for three codebases.

- **Flutter (or other cross-platform frameworks):** React Native preferred due to stronger existing team familiarity with React/JavaScript and its larger ecosystem.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Reduced development and maintenance costs with a single UI codebase.
- Faster feature rollout across web and mobile platforms simultaneously.
- Improved code quality and maintainability due to TypeScript.
- Leverages existing React developer skills and a large component ecosystem.

### Negative

- Performance may not match fully native apps for highly intensive tasks.
- Achieving a truly native look-and-feel on each platform may require extra effort.
- Reliance on React Native bridge for native features; potential for larger app size.
- A bug in the shared codebase can affect all platforms.
