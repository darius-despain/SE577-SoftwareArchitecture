# ADR 4: Kubernetes Container Orchestration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

"Home Cook Collective" anticipates variable user traffic, with peaks around mealtimes. The application's backend services require a deployment platform that offers robust scalability to handle these fluctuations efficiently, ensures high availability during peak usage, and supports modern cloud-native practices for deployment and management.

## Decision

We will use Kubernetes as the container orchestration platform for deploying and managing the services of "Home Cook Collective."

## Rationale

Kubernetes was chosen because:

- Its powerful auto-scaling capabilities allow efficient resource utilization by adjusting to traffic demands (e.g., during mealtimes).
- Its self-healing features enhance reliability.
- As an industry-standard for container orchestration, it offers extensive community support, a rich ecosystem, and promotes a declarative approach to infrastructure, aligning with modern cloud-native architecture.

### Rejected Alternatives

- **Non-Containerized Architecture (e.g., direct VM deployment):** Rejected due to lower deployment density, slower scaling, less efficient resource utilization, and more complex environment management compared to containerization.
- **Docker Swarm:** Considered as a simpler orchestration tool, but Kubernetes was chosen for its more extensive feature set for scaling, service discovery, and overall ecosystem maturity, which are deemed beneficial for long-term growth.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Enhanced scalability through automatic scaling of application services based on demand.
- Improved reliability by providing self-healing (restarting failed containers) and rolling updates, increasing application uptime.
- Better packing of applications onto underlying infrastructure can lead to cost savings during periods of low usage.
- Facilitates advanced deployment strategies like A/B testing and provides greater deployment flexibility.
- Access to a wide range of tools and integrations for monitoring, logging, and service management.

### Negative

- Kubernetes has a steep learning curve and operational overhead, potentially requiring specialized platform engineering skills or reliance on managed Kubernetes services.
- Can be resource-heavy for very small deployments, though managed services can mitigate some of this.
- Defining and managing Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) can be verbose and complex.
